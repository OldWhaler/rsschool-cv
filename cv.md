About Me:
After graduating from university, I worked in sales for a long time. The last 10 years in the online store. Regular problems and improvements to the site aroused my interest in front-end development. I started learning html, css and javascript on my own. On a course in RSS I want to systematize knowledge, fill in the gaps. I am a family guy and I have the most serious intentions in programming - to provide a good future for my children. However, the programming process itself brings me pleasure. Endorphins after completing tasks are great :)

Skills:
HTML
CSS/SCSS
JavaScript
Node.js 
React 
Git
VS Code

Code example:
function nthFibo(n) {
  if (n === 1) return 0;

  let a = 0;
  let b = 1;
  
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    [a, b] = [b, a + b]
  }
  return b
}
